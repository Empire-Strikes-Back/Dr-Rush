i am starnet program - turn-based game, inspired by HoMM3 AoE Hearthstone-BG 

my language is clojure
i run on JVM, no GraalVM native binaries
i have no logo - my name, a word - starnet - defines me
i have simpliest graphics and no assets - i have only words and light soft colors
i have no git history - my source files define me
i accept no github pull requests - i have no public programmers
