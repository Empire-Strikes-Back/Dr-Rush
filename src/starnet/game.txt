i am starnet game program, i say:

players defend starnet, they have one shot opportunity of preventing launch of netconrol (controldrone)
players research, change, build, balance a missiondrone and a team - a hero and research drones
the winner's missiondrone and team will take on the mission of protecting startnet from netcontrol's takeover

i have planets & teleports, remote controlled drones, ships
i start by teleporting player's team to the map - map is a planet
my entities vary - sets, tags, combinations: code,warp drives, fields, elements, fruit, self-orient time
heros and reserach drones start from 0

my map is tiled
player collects varios items, chooses different options, experiencing effects to build a better missionship
i am value-transparent with few things to learn, i provide calculations, while players focus on the picture and decisions, not arithmetics
my maps, items quantities and even qualities are randomized
i use randomness for initial generation only
my optimal playing time is ~15-90 min

i am complete, balanced, i have a complete set of entities, no expansions
my entities have tags: gathering organic discovery
droids have
  drive types 
  research abilities
  distance speed
i allow players to
  combine parts compute fields drives
  seek research quality
  improve compute capabilities, decision making, accuracy, energy, vision, vitality

i place players (azure and orange) the map, charachter is represented with a cape
1 hero, 3 research drones (represented with a colored sphere)
i represent missiondrone  with a large sphere (possible made of nanites) and orbiting supporting spheredrones
map is visible and open to both opponents equally, 128x128
players are not competing for resources, what one can get, the other can as well
players choose their initial position on the map 
players research, collect, rebalance, by roaming the map
players choose what to visit and collect, make choices, balance the missiondrone's and the team's characterisitics
players see each others moves, but not choices (the missiondrone build, team's stats)
player can visit a fruit tree to improve certain skills of a hero, for example, or visit and select nanite modules for the missiondrone
players have limited moves per day, limited days (i say, 7)
total time for 7 days - 15min
every 5 mins i do a battle simulation, 30sec per move, 3rd battle is final
in the battle goal is to disable(defeat) opponent's mission drone
hero and research drones are engaged and support (they also develop skills and abilities)
no distance
  movement in terms of energy spent at places, and increasable limit on how many places can be visited
missiondrone attributes
  compute capabilities
  data bank
  knowledge bank
  independent agent programs (for unpredictability)
  fields
  networking range
  design quility
  human interface simplicity
  abstraction level (like an age in AoE)
  defensive/offensive resources
  energy
hero
  accuracy
  decisionmaking
  resolve
  drone design 
  reach (movement)
  creativity(ideas)
  endurance (energy)
  vision
reserach drone
  reach
  reserach capabilites
  absctraction level
  fields
  hull
  energy
  hoisting (carrying) capacity


i do no portion-feeding - my map is visible, open-to-understanding from the beginning
player knows their options and can build towards final composition
i do not cap player thought process: if palyer opts, they can think start-to-end
i give players equal resources
players always see each others progress and decisions
